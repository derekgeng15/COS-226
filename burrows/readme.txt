Programming Assignment 8: Burrows-Wheeler

/* *****************************************************************************
 *  Which sorting algorithm did you use in CircularSuffixArray.java?
 *  Why did you choose it?
 **************************************************************************** */


/* *****************************************************************************
 *  How long does your implementation of the Burrows-Wheeler data compression
 *  algorithm (BurrowsWheeler + MoveToFront + Huffman) take to compress and
 *  expand mobydick.txt? What is the compression ratio (number of bytes in
 *  compressed message divided by the number of bytes in the message)?
 *  Compare the results to that for running Huffman alone and GNU 
 *  command-line utility Gzip.

See the Checklist for Bash commands to compress/expand.



/* *****************************************************************************
 *  What is the running time of each of the following methods as a function
 *  of the input size n and the alphabet size R, both in practice
 *  (on typical English text inputs) and in theory (in the worst case)?
 *  Use big Theta notation to simplify your answer (e.g., n, n + R, n log n,
 *  n log^2n n, n^2, or R n).
 *
 *  Include the time for sorting circular suffixes in Burrows-Wheeler
 *  transform().
